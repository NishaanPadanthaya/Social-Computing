This Repository contains files for the Social computing project titled "Exploring Topic Modelling using LLMs and Graphs: A Comprehensive Review with Graph Analytics".
This project combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced clustering techniques and topic modeling techniques to analyze research literature across key domains such as healthcare, 
economics, climate change, psychology, and artificial intelligence. After extracting these clusters of research topics, we employ graph analytics to reveal hidden relationships, 
central themes, and emerging trends. This comprehensive approach provides deeper insights into the research landscape, surpassing the capabilities of traditional topic modeling methods.
